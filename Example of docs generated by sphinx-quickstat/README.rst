Instruction
==============
DO NOT copy the whole content. all contents (including unecessary content to you) are placed here to make it simple to follow.


1. run sphinx-quickstart in desired folder
2. replace your source/conf.py with this source/conf.py
3. adjust index.rst to your needs
4. add new .rst that you may need for documentation (at this point, you can read or learn how to do this step by reading readthedocs)
